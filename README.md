# Hello Devops
This repository contains a very basic Angular application which can be published as an Azure Devops extension.

## Create extension
`vss-extension.json` - Update the publisher field with your publisher id

Run `npm run build` to create a VSIX file and then upload this file to the Visual Studio marketplace.
